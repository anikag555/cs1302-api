## Part 1: App Description
    This app takes a zip code as the user input to find moview reviews of the currently playing movies in that area along with
    movie data such as showtimes, casting, and theaters. The app displays a gallery of the currently playing movies (and posters)
    from the results of the user's query via the GraceNote API, and when a user selects a movie, a popup displays the first
    10 reviews, movie information, and links to the possible showtimes from the TMDB API. The app accounts for invalid
    zip codes, invalid user input, or lack of movie reviews through error handling.

## Part 2: New
    I learned how there are such vast public APIs are readily avaliable, like data.gov, along with how much immense data can be
    handled in applications or further development. I also learned a lot more how to convert publicly avaliable data into JSON
    form that can be used in Java applications. I found it exciting to have more control over the front-end aspect, so I could
    create an aesthetically pleasing GUI.

## Part 3: Retrospect
    If I could start over from scratch, I would spend more time improving the aesthetics rather than solely focusing on the
    backend, which is equally as important. In addition, I would like to have made the links to possible showtimes active so
    the user can be redirected to Fandango to purchase tickets. I would also have liked to allow the user to add their own
    reviews.
